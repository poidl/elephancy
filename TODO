Tests:
*) non-existing path must return 404
*) does navigation work if javascript is disabled? browser history? pushState popstate?

Bugs:
*) If the file to be fingerprinted is not present, the following error message occurs: "update_cache.go:46: Error executing fingerprint in bash"
    Find better error message
*) /staticcache shouldn't be readable! only fingerprinted
*) mobile: close menu when clicking on background
*) requesting /robots.txt results in weirdness (only in chromium?) 
*) Caching: If test1.html is updated and deployed, the old page gets loaded
*) If template is changed during running server, users who request a page are stuck with the old template (because they get the new timestamp without the new content) see solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36951855/is-it-possible-to-reload-html-templates-after-app-is-started

CSS:
*) h2/h3 fonts look way too thin on mobile (see e.g. Skills)

Caching:
*) in function fingerprint.sh, remove old filename tags automatically
*) use templating for static files. Automatically update all links to fingerprinted files (e.g. in frame.html) 

Other:
*) put all resources that have to be uploaded to the server in *one* directory, e.g. 
    /resources/restapi
    /resources/frontendclient
*) Check if directories and/or individual files should be readable. /frontend/staticcache/ /json/pages.json are readable. Is that a problem? Search engines?
*) check if content header plain text is right in ajaxYesHandler.
*) check if "304 not modified" is wrongly sent if index.html is modified and / is requested.
*) change title also in go templates! not only on client side
*) check if all pages in pages.json have different names, Urlpaths etc.
*) test if non-xhr calls to /content/ are redirected with a 302 (found) to /.

Documentation:
*) why not generate static content?
